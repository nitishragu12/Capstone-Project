## Introduction

The Western Australian Centre for Road Safety Research (WACRSR) is initiating a project to automate the manual process of scanning and analyzing road safety literature. Currently, this process is labor-intensive, taking up valuable time that could be better spent on critical research tasks. To address this, the project aims to develop a system that leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to streamline literature scanning and evaluation.
